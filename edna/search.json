    "text": "📈 PCR amplification\n\nGoal: To amplify a target DNA barcode region from eDNA extracts to detectable levels using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\n\n\nPCR targets a barcode region used for species identification.\nPrimers are short, custom‑made DNA sequences that define the start and end points of the region to be amplified. They are ordered from suppliers such as IDT or Eurofins.\nTwo primers are needed:\n\nForward primer – binds to the forward strand just before the barcode region, matching the sequence in the 5′ → 3′ direction.\nReverse primer – binds to the complementary strand just after the barcode region, but its sequence is still written in the 5′ → 3′ direction by convention, even though it binds in the opposite orientation.\n\nThese primers flank the barcode, allowing DNA polymerase to copy the specific region between them, producing a copy or an amplicon containing the barcode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding primers and binding\n\n\n\nDNA stores genetic instructions as a double‑stranded helix made of nucleotides, each containing one of four bases.\nBases pair specifically (A with T, C with G), so if one strand reads:\n5′– A T G C C A T –3′\nthe complementary strand will read:\n3′– T A C G G T A –5′\nDNA strands are antiparallel, running in opposite directions, with one end labeled 5′ (five prime) and the other 3′ (three prime). DNA synthesis always proceeds in the 5′ → 3′ direction, which is important because DNA polymerases can only extend in this direction. This directionality must be considered when designing primers.\nIn PCR, two primers define the start and end of the region to be amplified.\nExample: For a 1000 bp DNA fragment with a barcode between positions 421 and 579:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion\nPosition range\nExample sequence\n\n\n\n\nForward primer\n400–420 (5′ → 3′)\nGTCGGTAAAACTCGTGCCAGC (MiFish-U-F)\n\n\nBarcode region\n421–579\nAGCCTTGAGAACTGCTTAC...\n\n\nReverse primer\n580–600 (5′ → 3′ on reverse strand)\nCATAGTGGGGTATCTAATCCCAGTTTG (MiFish-U-R)\n\n\n\nThe primers flank the barcode, allowing DNA polymerase to copy the segment between them — the amplicon — which is then used for species identification.\n\n\n\nPCR involves repeated thermal cycling:\n\nDenaturation (~94–95 °C): DNA strands are separated into single strands.\nAnnealing (~50–60 °C): Forward and reverse primers bind to their complementary sequences flanking the target barcode.\nSynthesis/Extension (72 °C): DNA polymerase (e.g. Taq) synthesises new DNA strands between the primers.\n\nThis cycle is repeated ~35–40 times. Each cycle doubles the amount of target DNA.\n\nThe result is millions of identical amplicons of just the barcode region — ready for sequencing.\n\n\n\n\nPCR process\n\n\n\n\nTypical PCR mix includes:\n\neDNA extract\nForward & reverse primers\nDNA polymerase (e.g. Taq)\ndNTPs (A, T, C, G)\nBuffer\n\nControls:\n\nPositive control: contains known DNA to confirm amplification\nNegative control: no DNA added — detects contamination\nOptimised annealing temperature: ensures specific primer binding\n\nAfter PCR, amplicons can be verified using gel electrophoresis before sequencing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Taq Polymerase and what does it do?\n\n\n\nTaq polymerase is a DNA polymerase originally isolated from the heat-tolerant bacterium Thermus aquaticus.\n\nIt is heat-stable, meaning it remains active during high-temperature cycles (e.g. 94–95 °C).\nIt is the most widely used enzyme for standard PCR because it:\n\nTolerates repeated heating and cooling\n\nEfficiently synthesises DNA at ~72 °C during the extension step\n\n\nTaq polymerase builds a new strand of DNA by adding nucleotide building blocks (A, T, C, G) to a template strand.\nIt starts at the primer and matches each base with its complement:\n\nA pairs with T\n\nC pairs with G\n\nThis creates a new, complementary strand — essentially copying the original DNA."

    "text": "A relatív abundancia megértése az eDNS-vizsgálatokban\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRRA\n\n\n\nAz eDNS használatakor a teljes mintának csak egy részét használjuk fel, és a PCR torzítást eredményez azáltal, hogy több millió DNS-kópiát hoz létre. Ez felveti a kérdést:\nHogyan bízhatunk abban, hogy a leolvasott DNS-ek száma (vagy a “leolvasások száma”) tükrözi a fajok valódi gyakoriságát a környezetben?\nA PCR exponenciálisan sokszorozza a DNS-t - ideális esetben minden egyes ciklusban megduplázza a DNS-kópiák számát. Ez a folyamat azonban az amplifikációs torzítást eredményez, mint például:\n\nPrimerhatékonysági torzítás: egyes szekvenciák jobban kötődnek a primerekhez és könnyebben amplifikálódnak.\nSablonpreferencia: bizonyos DNS-szekvenciák előnyben részesülnek a másolás során.\nPlateau-effektus: az erőforrások kimerülésével az amplifikáció lelassul és leáll.\nRészmintavételezés: a teljes DNS-nek csak egy kis részét használják fel a PCR-hez és a szekvenáláshoz.\n\nEz azt jelenti, hogy a PCR nem őrzi meg pontosan a DNS eredeti arányait - a DNS jelenlétét igazolja, de nem a tökéletes bőséget. A leolvasásszámlálás még mindig hasznos, de óvatosan. Míg a PCR torzítja az abszolút mennyiségeket, a leolvasott számok még mindig ökológiai jeleket hordoznak, különösen a domináns fajok esetében. A kutatók jellemzően a következőket használják:\n\nRelatív leolvasásszám (Relative Read Abundance, RRA):\n\nA leolvasások 40%-a = európai tengeri sügér\nA leolvasások 10%-a = háromágú pálcikacsík.\n\n\nAz RRA lehetővé teszi a mintázatok összehasonlítását a különböző helyszíneken vagy körülmények között, nem pedig a pontos organizmusszámok összehasonlítását.\nA szekvenálás után egy olvasatszámtáblázat mutatja, hogy az egyes fajok esetében mintánként hány olvasatot detektáltunk. Ahhoz, hogy ezek az adatok összehasonlíthatóak legyenek, a következő technikákat alkalmazzuk:\nNormalizálás\nCél: A különböző szekvenálási mélységek (azaz a mintánkénti különböző teljes olvasatszámok) kiigazítása.\n\nArányos skálázás: a nyers számokat relatív arányokká (az összes olvasat %-ában) alakítja át.\nLog-transzformáció: tompítja a nagyon gyakori fajok hatását.\nModellalapú megközelítések: pl. DESeq2, edgeR - a számlálási variabilitást statisztikailag figyelembe veszi.\n\nRarefaction\nCél: A szekvenálási ráfordítások standardizálása a minták között.\n\nMinden adatkészletet közös olvasatszámra (pl. 10 000 olvasat mintánként) vegyen részmintát.\nBiztosítja a diverzitás tisztességes összehasonlítását.\nMegakadályozza a gazdagság túlbecslését a mélyebben szekvenált mintákban.\n\nKompromisszum: egyes adatok (pl. ritka olvasatok) elvesznek, de az eredmények kevésbé torzítottak.\nStatisztikai eszközök\nMiután az adatokat normalizáltuk vagy ritkítottuk, különböző ökológiai és statisztikai elemzéseket alkalmazhatunk:\n\nDiverzitási indexek: Shannon, Simpson - a fajgazdagság és az egyenletesség mérésére.\nRendezés: PCA, NMDS, PCoA - a helyszínek közötti mintázatok megjelenítésére.\nHipotézisvizsgálat: PERMANOVA, ANOSIM - csoportok vagy kezelések összehasonlítására\nÖkológiai modellezés: A környezeti tényezők és a közösségek közötti kapcsolatok feltárása"

    "text": "Understanding relative abundance in eDNA studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRRA\n\n\n\nWhen using eDNA, only a portion of the total sample is being used, and then PCR introduces bias by creating millions of DNA copies. This raises the question:\nHow can we trust that the number of DNA reads (or “read counts”) reflects the true abundance of species in the environment?\nPCR amplifies DNA exponentially — ideally doubling the number of DNA copies with each cycle. However, this process introduces amplification bias, such as:\n\nPrimer efficiency bias: some sequences bind primers better and amplify more easily.\nTemplate preference: certain DNA sequences are preferentially copied.\nPlateau effect: as resources deplete, amplification slows and stops.\nSubsampling: only a small portion of the total DNA is used for PCR and sequencing.\n\nThis means PCR doesn’t preserve the original proportions of DNA exactly — it confirms presence, but not perfect abundance. Read counts still be useful but cautiously. While PCR distorts absolute quantities, read counts still carry ecological signals, especially for dominant species. Researchers typically use:\n\nRelative Read Abundance (RRA):\n\n40% of reads = European seabass\n10% of reads = Threespine stickleback\n\n\nRRA allows us to compare patterns across sites or conditions, not exact organism numbers.\nAfter sequencing, a read count table shows how many reads were detected for each species per sample. To make this data comparable, the following techniques are applied:\nNormalisation\nGoal: Adjust for different sequencing depths (i.e. different total read numbers per sample).\n\nProportional scaling: convert raw counts to relative proportions (% of total reads).\nLog transformation: dampens the influence of very abundant species.\nModel-based approaches: e.g. DESeq2, edgeR — account for count variability statistically.\n\nRarefaction\nGoal: Standardise sequencing effort across samples.\n\nSubsample each dataset to a common number of reads (e.g. 10,000 per sample).\nEnsures fair comparisons of diversity.\nPrevents overestimating richness in deeper sequenced samples.\n\nTrade-off: some data (e.g. rare reads) is lost, but results are less biased.\nStatistical tools\nOnce data is normalised or rarefied, we can use various ecological and statistical analyses:\n\nDiversity indices: Shannon, Simpson – to measure species richness and evenness\nOrdination: PCA, NMDS, PCoA – to visualise patterns between sites\nHypothesis testing: PERMANOVA, ANOSIM – to compare groups or treatments\nEcological modelling: Explore links between environmental drivers and communities"

This reaction forms a phosphodiester bond, linking the 3′ carbon of one sugar to the phosphate on the 5′ carbon of the next nucleotide. The result is a continuous sugar–phosphate backbone.\n\n\n\n\nSugar-phosphate backbone\n\n\n\n\n\nArrangement in the double helix\n\nBackbone location: the sugar–phosphate backbones run along the outside edges of the helix.\nBase pairing: the nitrogenous bases project inward from the backbone and pair specifically with bases on the opposite strand:\n\nAdenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T) via two hydrogen bonds\nGuanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C) via three hydrogen bonds\n\n\nThese complementary base pairs hold the two strands together, maintaining the uniform shape of the double helix.\n\n\n\n\nStructure of DNA (Source: NIH)\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectionality of strands\nThe carbon atoms in deoxyribose are numbered 1′ to 5′:\n\nC1′ – bonds to the nitrogenous base\nC3′ – has an –OH group that bonds to the phosphate of the next nucleotide\nC4′ – part of the ring structure\nC5′ is not in the ring — it sticks out from C4′ and is attached to the phosphate group\n\nOne strand runs 5′ → 3′ (free phosphate at the 5′ end, free –OH at the 3′ end), while the complementary strand runs 3′ → 5′.\n\n\n\n\na) The sugar-phosphate backbones are on the outside of the double helix and purines (A, G) and pyrimidines (C, T) form the “rungs” of the DNA helix ladder. b) The two DNA strands are antiparallel to each other. c) The direction of each strand is identified by numbering the carbons (1 through 5) in each sugar molecule.\n\n\n\nImportance of the antiparallel arrangement\n\nBase pairing: stable hydrogen bonds form only when strands run in opposite directions, maintaining the uniform width of the helix.\nReplication: DNA polymerase adds nucleotides only to the 3′ end of a growing strand.\nStability: opposite orientation and phosphate positioning reduce electrostatic repulsion, helping stabilise the helical structure."

The choice of genetic marker is critical—short mitochondrial gene fragments (such as the 12S rRNA gene) are often preferred due to their high copy number per cell, broad primer compatibility across taxa, and resistance to degradation in environmental samples.\neDNA detection approaches can be grouped into three main categories:\n\nSpecies-specific detection: This method focuses on detecting individual taxa using species-specific primers and is especially useful for tracking endangered, rare, or invasive species.\n\nCommon techniques:\n\nConventional PCR (cPCR): Amplicons are visualised via gel electrophoresis.\nQuantitative real-time PCR (qPCR): Tracks amplification in real time using fluorescence.\nNested PCR (nPCR): A two-step process that enhances sensitivity and specificity by re-amplifying a fragment within a broader target region. Useful for detecting low-abundance or elusive species.\nDigital Droplet PCR (ddPCR): Partitions the sample into thousands of individual reactions. Ideal for detecting rare species in complex environmental samples.\n\n\neDNA metabarcoding: Enables the simultaneous detection of multiple species from a single eDNA sample using universal primers targeting conserved gene regions (e.g. 12S for vertebrates).\neDNA metagenomics: Metagenomics involves direct shotgun sequencing of all DNA in a sample—without amplification.
