    "text": "📈 PCR amplification\n\nGoal: To amplify a target DNA barcode region from eDNA extracts to detectable levels using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\n\n\nPCR targets a short, standardised gene region (a “barcode”) used for species identification.\nFor fish, the 12S rRNA mitochondrial gene is commonly used as a barcode.\nPrimers are short, synthetic DNA sequences (~18–25 base pairs) that define the start and end points of the target region to be amplified.\nThey are custom-designed and ordered from commercial suppliers (e.g. IDT, Eurofins) and are essential for selectively amplifying barcode regions.\nTwo primers are needed:\n\nA forward primer, which binds to one strand at the start of the barcode region (5′→3′ direction).\nA reverse primer, which binds to the opposite strand at the end of the region (also written 5′→3′ but binds in the reverse orientation).\n\nThese primers flank the barcode, allowing DNA polymerase to copy the specific region between them.\nExample Primers (MiFish 12S):\n\nForward primer: GTCGGTAAAACTCGTGCCAGC (MiFish-U-F)\nReverse primer: CATAGTGGGGTATCTAATCCCAGTTTG (MiFish-U-R)\n\nPCR involves repeated thermal cycling:\n\nDenaturation (~94–95 °C): DNA strands are separated into single strands.\nAnnealing (~50–60 °C): Forward and reverse primers bind to their complementary sequences flanking the target barcode.\nSynthesis/Extension (72 °C): DNA polymerase (e.g. Taq) synthesises new DNA strands between the primers.\n\nThis cycle is repeated ~35–40 times. Each cycle doubles the amount of target DNA.\n\nThe result is millions of identical copies (amplicons) of just the barcode region — ready for sequencing.\n\n\n\n\nPCR process\n\n\n\n\nTypical PCR mix includes:\n\neDNA extract\nForward & reverse primers\nDNA polymerase (e.g. Taq)\ndNTPs (A, T, C, G)\nBuffer\n\nControls:\n\nPositive control: Contains known DNA to confirm amplification\nNegative control: No DNA added — detects contamination\nOptimised annealing temperature: Ensures specific primer binding\n\nAfter PCR, amplicons can be verified using gel electrophoresis before sequencing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Taq Polymerase and what does it do?\n\n\n\nTaq polymerase is a DNA polymerase originally isolated from the heat-tolerant bacterium Thermus aquaticus.\n\nIt is heat-stable, meaning it remains active during high-temperature cycles (e.g., 94–95 °C).\nIt is the most widely used enzyme for standard PCR because it:\n\nTolerates repeated heating and cooling\n\nEfficiently synthesises DNA at ~72 °C during the extension step\n\n\nTaq polymerase builds a new strand of DNA by adding nucleotide building blocks (A, T, C, G) to a template strand.\nIt starts at the primer and matches each base with its complement:\n\nA pairs with T\n\nC pairs with G\n\nThis creates a new, complementary strand — essentially copying the original DNA."

    "text": "Understanding relative abundance in eDNA studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRRA\n\n\n\nWhen using eDNA, only a portion of the total sample is being used, and then PCR introduces bias by creating millions of DNA copies. This raises the question:\nHow can we trust that the number of DNA reads (or “read counts”) reflects the true abundance of species in the environment?\nPCR amplifies DNA exponentially — ideally doubling the number of DNA copies with each cycle. However, this process introduces amplification bias, such as:\n\nPrimer efficiency bias: some sequences bind primers better and amplify more easily.\nTemplate preference: certain DNA sequences are preferentially copied.\nPlateau effect: as resources deplete, amplification slows and stops.\nSubsampling: only a small portion of the total DNA is used for PCR and sequencing.\n\nThis means PCR doesn’t preserve the original proportions of DNA exactly — it confirms presence, but not perfect abundance. Read counts still be useful but cautiously. While PCR distorts absolute quantities, read counts still carry ecological signals, especially for dominant species. Researchers typically use:\n\nRelative Read Abundance (RRA):\n\n40% of reads = European seabass\n10% of reads = Threespine stickleback\n\n\nRRA allows us to compare patterns across sites or conditions, not exact organism numbers.\nAfter sequencing, a read count table shows how many reads were detected for each species per sample. To make this data comparable, the following techniques are applied:\nNormalisation\nGoal: Adjust for different sequencing depths (i.e. different total read numbers per sample).\n\nProportional scaling: convert raw counts to relative proportions (% of total reads).\nLog transformation: dampens the influence of very abundant species.\nModel-based approaches: e.g. DESeq2, edgeR — account for count variability statistically.\n\nRarefaction\nGoal: Standardise sequencing effort across samples.\n\nSubsample each dataset to a common number of reads (e.g. 10,000 per sample).\nEnsures fair comparisons of diversity.\nPrevents overestimating richness in deeper sequenced samples.\n\nTrade-off: some data (e.g. rare reads) is lost, but results are less biased.\nStatistical tools\nOnce data is normalised or rarefied, we can use various ecological and statistical analyses:\n\nDiversity indices: Shannon, Simpson – to measure species richness and evenness\nOrdination: PCA, NMDS, PCoA – to visualise patterns between sites\nHypothesis testing: PERMANOVA, ANOSIM – to compare groups or treatments\nEcological modelling: Explore links between environmental drivers and communities"
