Apply parafilm to cover the smooth outlet of the filter.\nPipette 50 mL of the TE resuspension buffer into the capsule through the ridged inlet and seal with more parafilm.\nAgitate capsule for five minutes; a fingertip can be placed over each end and the capsule manually shaken, or if parafilm is securely taped into place, the capsule can be held against a vortex.\nPour the solution back into the first 50 mL Falcon tube, and repeat steps 5 and 6 for the second 50 mL Falcon tube, ending up with two 50 mL Falcon tubes of eDNA resuspended from the filter in turbid TE buffer. The spent Waterra filter can be thrown away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is TE Buffer?\n\n\n\nTE buffer (Tris-EDTA, pH 8.0) is used to gently release DNA from inside the Waterra capsule.\n\nTris (50 mM): stabilises pH\n\nEDTA (10 mM): binds divalent cations (e.g., Mg²⁺, Ca²⁺) to inhibit DNases and protect DNA integrity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTE Buffer (Tris-EDTA) Recipe – 5 L Total\n\n\n\n\n\n🧾 Ingredients (for 5 L)\n\n250 mL of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)\n→ Final concentration: 50 mM\n100 mL of 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0)\n→ Final concentration: 10 mM\n4,650 mL of ultrapure water\n→ To bring total volume to 5,000 mL (5 L)\n\n\n\n\n🧂 Instructions\n\nIn a clean 5 L glass bottle, add:\n\n250 mL of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)\n\n100 mL of 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0)\n\nAdd ultrapure water up to the 5 L mark.\nMix thoroughly by gently inverting or stirring.\nLabel with:\n\nContents (e.g. “TE Buffer, pH 8.0”)\nPreparation date\nInitials\n\nStore at room temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCentrifuging\n\nCentrifuge the two 50 mL Falcon tubes for 10 minutes at 4500 rpm to separate debris/sediment from the liquid DNA-containing fraction.\n\nSupernatant: the clear upper layer, containing eDNA in solution\nPellet: the sediment settled at the bottom of the tube\n\n\n\n\nFiltering through funnel filter\n\nAn analytical test filter funnel attached to a Buchner funnel and peristaltic pump is used to filter the buffer mix through a 0.45-micron disc filter (Nalgene™).\nCombine the two Falcon tubes per sample by pouring the now clear supernatant from both tubes through the funnel, trying to retain the sediment in the tubes.\nAdjust the speed of the peristaltic pump to pull the supernatant through the funnel, with an additional minute of filtering to dry the funnel filter disc. Samples which required multiple filters due to build-up of sediment can be consolidated into one analytical filter funnel.\nUpon completion, one funnel filter disc should contain the filtered supernatant, and the remaining sediment should be retained in the original two Falcon tubes.\n\n\n\nQiagen DNeasy PowerWater\n\nFILTER: Remove the upper portion of the disposable filter funnel to expose the white membrane of the filter disc. Using sterile forceps (use 25% bleach solution and rinse with RO water). Roll up the filter membrane with the top side facing inwards, and insert into a 5 mL PowerWater DNA bead tube. Add 1 mL of PW1 solution.\nSEDIMENT: Add 1 mL PW1 solution to one of the Falcon tubes containing sediment. Use the PW1 solution to rinse out the tube into the second Falcon.

To recover DNA:\n\nThe soaked filter fragments were transferred into a QIAshredder column\nThe remaining lysate was pooled before proceeding with the DNeasy protocol\n\nA negative control was included in every extraction batch.\nAll extractions and controls were quantified using a Qubit v2 fluorometer with the dsDNA BR Assay Kit (Invitrogen).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials\n\n\n\nThe following materials are required for the resuspension, filtration, and DNA extraction steps:\n\nTE buffer (50 mM Tris, 10 mM EDTA)\n\n50 mL Falcon tubes\n\nParafilm (for sealing filter ends)\n\nBuchner funnel (connected to peristaltic pump)\n\n0.45-micron disc filter (e.g. Nalgene™)\n\nProteinase K (for protein digestion)\n\nQIAshredder (for lysate clean-up)\n\nDNeasy PowerWater Kit (Qiagen)\n\nBlue roll and bleach (for surface decontamination)"
