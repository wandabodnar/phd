Apply parafilm to cover the smooth outlet of the filter.\nPipette 50 mL of the TE resuspension buffer into the capsule through the ridged inlet and seal with more parafilm.\nAgitate capsule for five minutes; a fingertip can be placed over each end and the capsule manually shaken, or if parafilm is securely taped into place, the capsule can be held against a vortex.\nPour the solution back into the first 50 mL Falcon tube, and repeat steps 5 and 6 for the second 50 mL Falcon tube, ending up with two 50 mL Falcon tubes of eDNA resuspended from the filter in turbid TE buffer.
